# Ragnarok MVP Timer
This page was developed in order to allow you to save your MvP's time in an easy way.

Release the audio permission in your browser to receive a notification when the MvP is born.

It's very easy to use, just select the mvp you just killed, and click add

Optionally you can also enter the coordinates and time of death, if you don't enter the mvp is configured without tomb and the time of death becomes the current one. If you enter the time, the chosen time will be set to time of death.
